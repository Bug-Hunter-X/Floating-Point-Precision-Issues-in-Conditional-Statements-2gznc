# Julia Floating Point Precision Bug
This repository demonstrates a common issue in Julia related to floating-point precision in conditional statements. The `bug.jl` file contains a function that works correctly with integers, but produces unexpected behavior with floating-point numbers due to precision errors. The `bugSolution.jl` file offers a solution to this issue using appropriate tolerance levels for comparisons.
